# GroveBlocks
Grove Blocks is a Blockly App for Arduino using the Grove system for components. Firstly, every Grove module has had a library created for it, so in Arduino, you can do Object Oriented Programming. This Blockly App makes it easy to produce that Object Oriented code. Can check out at https://avyr9wd.opalstacked.com/grove4/login.php and just use the LOGIN AS GUEST button down the bottom to access (but no access to Save or Load). Before uploading to Arduino, you'll need all the Libraries in your Arduino Library folder. Every object (even buttons and LEDs!!!) use their own Library (which is not optimal but teaches about classes, objects/instances, and methods associated with a class of objects).
